In the Udemy course, we learned about deep learning and neural networks, exploring various architectures like MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs using TensorFlow and Keras.
We also ventured into the world of modern generative AI, uncovering the inner workings of transformers, self-attention mechanisms, and 
large language models such as GPT. The practical application of this knowledge involved utilizing the OpenAI API for GPT and ChatGPT and even fine-tuning GPT models with 
custom training data. Additionally, we ventured into the realm of computer vision with Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 
synthetic image generation. The course further encompassed a diverse array of topics, ranging from data visualization, transfer learning, sentiment analysis, 
image recognition, regression, clustering, to reinforcement learning, providing a comprehensive understanding of essential machine learning and data science concepts and techniques.


In this Final Project I have to apply several different supervised machine learning techniques to the "mammographic masses" public data set, and see which one yields the
highest accuracy as measured with K-Fold cross validation (K=10). Apply:
Decision tree
Random forest
KNN
Naive Bayes
SVM
Logistic Regression
